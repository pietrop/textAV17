### Notes
- NYPL Transcript Editor 
- http://transcribe.oralhistory.nypl.org/
- Open sourced here: https://github.com/NYPL/transcript-editor
- "Spoken word into sheet music" Example: https://github.com/beefoo/still-i-rise
- Used Kaldi to get data down to the phoneme level of a word 
- After that, used Praat, another open source tool for phonetic analysis of speech. 
- It can extract pitch and intensity and what is called "voice pulses."
- Lilypond, another OSS tool for "engraving music"
