###Notes:
* 9 stations, 34 million listeners -- BBC is pretty big
* Transcription is rough and manual process (enough for them to understand whats going on -- slow and "waste of their time")
* Producers will pay other people to do it, in Australia which is overnight because of how time zones work, but only if they have the money
* Timed transcripts in 2002, SCANMail, meant for navigating voicemail using text
* Also this program called SILVER
* 2004, SCANMail could edit text
* Then a video editor can do transcripts with different camera angles and it auto edits the video so there are no awkward jump cuts
* (Association of Computing Machinery) ACM is the journal where all these examples are coming from: https://www.acm.org/publications/journals 
* Removing "ums" and other sounds
* 2016: prototype to quickly revise spoken comments
* Chris is now demo'ing some prototypes out of BBC R&D
* HTML5Compositor
* Demonstrates the Magic Pen tool where transcripts can be printed, written on with a specific pen with a camera, and having those edits uploaded back to the document so producers can work at their leisure / on the go / not in the office
* "Speech to text is a lossy process"

###Ideas for next steps
* Common base UI element for timed transcript editing
* Google Docs style collaborative time transcript editor/player
* Better, meaningful annotations (e.g. rate segments, export >4*)
* Template for EDL file generation
* Embed transcript and annotations in audio file
* Umm detection/removal (STT with umms?)
* Automatic segmentation with tagging and summaries
* Better time compression
* Tools for recording multiple versions of a script
* Digital pen with audio playback, natural annotation and live bidirectional sync
* Smart correction by exposing STT graphs
* Fast clipping of a live audio stream using transcripts
* Bidirectional integration with a proper audio editing system
