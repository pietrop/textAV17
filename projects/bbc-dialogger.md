9 stations, 34 million listeners -- BBC is pretty big
Transcription is rough and manual process (enough for them to understand whats going on -- slow and "waste of their time")
Producers will pay other people to do it, in Australia which is overnight because of how time zones work, but only if they have the money
Timed transcripts in 2002, SCANMail, meant for navigating voicemail using text
Also this program called SILVER
2004, SCANMail could edit text
Then a video editor can do transcripts with different camera angles and it auto edits the video so there are no awkward jump cuts
(Association of Computing Machinery) ACM is the journal where all these examples are coming from: https://www.acm.org/publications/journals

Demonstrates the Magic Pen tool where transcripts can be printed, written on with a specific pen with a camera, and having those edits uploaded back to the document so producers can work at their leisure / on the go / not in the office
