# Opened Captions: Real Time Caption API // Dan Schultz, Internet Archive



OpenedCaptions, a personal project made as a Knight-Mozilla fellow at Boston Globe. 
There's no API for closed captioning?!
Line21 Decoding device called TextGrabber, very rare
Node.js server grabs it and distributed to any listening clients
Dan made this thing that makes text get super drunk and is claiming that there are useful applications for this
Like maybe a language translation layer to get things into another language quickly
The value of having a standard (but this isn't a standard yet, FYI), is that things can grow out into more than one source, redistribution through a hub, making it push-based (easy to scale!)
Watch live CNN captions: https://openedcaptions.com (at the time, it was showing captions for a pharmaceutical commercial)
you can set up your own â€“ source and documentation on GitHub: https://github.com/slifty/opened-captions
Dan is now doing a live demo and it's important for the record to state that his terminal typeface of choice is Comic Sans
Get things from television (usually CSPAN) and write code against it
Question: What are the copyright considerations? Hope is that content creators see this and like it, and want to provide their own service about it. A lot of CSPAN is public domain.
Question: How do we know what channel it is on? Code has been in stasis but now it needs to be more robust, more than one channel may be running, and provide more info. Not there yet but anyone who wants to develop on it there's a lot of "low hanging fruit things" to make it more useful.  (PLEASE REACH OUT -- @slifty on twitter, or directly at slifty@gmail.com)
