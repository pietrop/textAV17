## Notes:

* OpenedCaptions, a personal project made as a Knight-Mozilla fellow at Boston Globe. 
* There's no API for closed captioning?!
* Line21 Decoding device called TextGrabber, very rare

  Node.js server grabs it and distributed to any listening clients

* Dan made this thing that makes text get super drunk and is claiming that there are useful applications for this
* Like maybe a language translation layer to get things into another language quickly
* The value of having a standard \(but this isn't a standard yet, FYI\), is that things can grow out into more than one source, redistribution through a hub, making it push-based \(easy to scale!\)
* Watch live CNN captions: [https://openedcaptions.com](https://openedcaptions.com) \(at the time, it was showing captions for a pharmaceutical commercial\)
* you can set up your own â€“ source and documentation on GitHub: [https://github.com/slifty/opened-captions](https://github.com/slifty/opened-captions)
* Dan is now doing a live demo and it's important for the record to state that his terminal typeface of choice is Comic Sans
* Get things from television \(usually CSPAN\) and write code against it
* Question: What are the copyright considerations? Hope is that content creators see this and like it, and want to provide their own service about it. A lot of CSPAN is public domain.
* Question: How do we know what channel it is on? 
  * Code has been in stasis but now it needs to be more robust, more than one channel may be running, and provide more info. 
  * Not there yet but anyone who wants to develop on it there's a lot of "low hanging fruit things" to make it more useful.  
* \(PLEASE REACH OUT -- @slifty on twitter, or directly at slifty@gmail.com\)
