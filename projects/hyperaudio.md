"As hypertext is to text, hyperaudio is to audio."
Hyperaudio is actually video!
Worked with Al Jazeera as a Mozilla-Knight open news fellow, mapping how often words are used in things like the presidential debate

(currently not working due to duff video link :( )
“When we synchronize audio with text, we can manipulate audio in the same way we can text.”
Demo available here: http://hyperaud.io/pad/
Edit, fade, trim.
This project was funded by the Knight Foundation.
“It was non-destructive editing”
