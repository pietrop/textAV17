[textAV.tech](http://textAV.tech) event description:

> TextAV is a three-day working group in New York City, July 19-21, 2017, with leading technologists, application developers, and practitioners working in the area of online audio and video, with a particular focus on the use of captions and transcripts to facilitate and speed up the production process.

[Here you can also read a source blog post by Molly Schwartz with her account what it was like to attend the first edition of textAV](https://source.opennews.org/articles/text-audio-and-meaning/).

The idea with this gitbook is to take the collaborative notes and video from the presentations of projects and problem domain and curate them into an easy to navigate resource that can be shared beyond the event.

It's also a chance to expand on lessons learned, road map and vision for each project.

Check out the [TODOS](/todos.md) section if you want to help with this effort.
