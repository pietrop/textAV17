[textAV.tech](http://textAV.tech) event description:

>TextAV is a three-day working group in New York City, July 19-21, 2017, with leading technologists, application developers, and practitioners working in the area of online audio and video, with a particular focus on the use of captions and transcripts to facilitate and speed up the production process.




The idea with this gitbook is to take the collaborative notes and video from the presentations of projects and problem domain and curate them into an easy to navigate resource that can be shared beyond the event. 

It's also a chance to expand on lessons learned, road map and vision for each project.
